# AM-Charts

The AM charts module is a powerful tool that allows users to easily create a variety of charts using React and the AMCharts framework. This module includes a range of customizable widgets for building charts with both static and dynamic data. AM Charts were designed to feel modern, sleek and fast, out-of-the box. It will be a useful module to make relatable charts in minutes.
Each chart widget is comprised of building blocks that can be easily incorporated into any page or view. This allows users to visualize data in a dynamic and interactive way, with the ability to update and refresh data on the fly.

At present, the module features a high-quality pie chart widget that can be fully customized to meet individual needs. However, future versions of the module will include a wide range of additional chart widgets, including bar charts, line charts, scatter plots, and more. These widgets will provide users with even greater flexibility and control over how they display and analyze data, helping them to make more informed decisions and gain deeper insights into their data.

Future release charts:
* Column & bar chart
*	Line & Area chart
*	Pie & Donut chart
*	XY & Bubble chart
*	Maps chart
*	Candlestick & OHLC chart
*	Stock chart
*	Gauges chart
